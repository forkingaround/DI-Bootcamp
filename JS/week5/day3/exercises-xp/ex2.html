    <h1>Exercise 2 : Promises</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a promise that resolves itself in 4 seconds and returns a “success” string.</li>
        <li>How can you make your promise from part 1 shorter using Promise.resolve() and console.log “success”?
            <mark>I could reduce the delay for the timeout</mark>
        </li>
        <li>Add code to catch errors and console.log ‘Ooops something went wrong’.
            <mark>How to test that tho?</mark>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <script>
        const timedFunc = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
            const timer = setTimeout(()=>{
                resolve("success");
            },4000);
        })
        .then(result => console.log(result))
        .catch(() => console.log('Ooops something went wrong')); //How do i text it ?

    </script>
